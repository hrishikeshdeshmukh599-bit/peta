<hr>
<center><p>To protect endangered animals, we must conserve their habitats by reducing pollution, buying sustainable products (like FSC wood, avoiding palm oil/ivory), and supporting conservation groups; also, educate yourself and others, reduce your carbon footprint, recycle, and never buy illegal wildlife products to directly help species and their environments thrive</p></center>
