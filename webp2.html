<hr>
<center><p>PETA India, based in Mumbai, was launched in January 2000. It operates under the simple principle that animals are not ours to experiment on, eat, wear, use for entertainment, or abuse in any other way, while also educating policymakers and the public about animal abuse and promoting an understanding of the right of all animals to be treated with respect.

PETA India focuses primarily on the areas in which the greatest numbers of animals suffer the most: in laboratories, in the food industry, in the leather trade, and in the entertainment business. PETA India’s investigations, public education efforts, research, animal rescues, legislative work, special events, celebrity involvement, and national media coverage have resulted in countless improvements to the quality of life for animals and have saved countless animals’ lives.</p></center>

We should save animals because they are crucial for healthy ecosystems (providing pollination, clean water/air), sustain human life through food and medicine, support economies (tourism, resources), hold deep cultural/aesthetic value, and our actions are causing a mass extinction, threatening our own survival. Every species plays a role in the "web of life," and losing them unravels the very systems that provide us with essential services and a habitable planet. 
Ecological & Environmental Reasons
Ecosystem Balance: Animals are fundamental to food webs and cycles, performing jobs like pollination (bees), pest control, soil formation, and water filtration. 
Biodiversity: Diverse species create resilient ecosystems that can better withstand change, benefiting everyone. 
Climate Regulation: Wildlife helps regulate climate through various natural processes, notes the IUCN Save Our Species. 
Human Benefits (Ecosystem Services)
Food & Medicine: Animals provide food, raw materials, and potential sources for new medicines. 
Economic Value: Wildlife supports tourism, livelihoods, and industries like sustainable forestry. 
Clean Resources: Healthy wildlife populations ensure we have clean air, water, and fertile land, as warned by GVI Australia and the Endangered Species Coalition. 
Ethical, Cultural & Aesthetic Reasons
Moral Duty: Many believe we have a responsibility to protect other living beings, especially since human activity drives their endangerment. 
Cultural Significance: Animals hold deep historical, spiritual, and cultural meanings for nearly every society, according to the IUCN Save Our Species. 
Inspiration: Wildlife provides beauty, wonder, and recreational value, notes Tour My India. 
Our Own Survival
Interconnectedness: We are part of nature, not separate from it; losing wildlife means losing essential life support systems, which threatens humanity's own future, say the World Wildlife Fund. </pre><br><br>
